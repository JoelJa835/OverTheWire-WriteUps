Bandit Level 1

After connecting to the bandit1 server with the password from bandit0, using ls we instantly observe a file named -. Using the cat command to get the contents of the file actually doesnt do what we expect because it waits for our input.Once you have typed something and pressed enter, it displays what we typed. For that reason, we have to specify that it is a file that we are looking for so we use : cat ./-.

Doing that prints the password needed for Bandit 2 Level.
