Bandit Level 0

In this level we just need to connect to the host bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port 2220 using ssh.

Basic ssh syntax:ssh user@domain and -p to specify the port. So the command is ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220.

After that we are asked for the password which was given to be: bandit0

Once connected to the server, running the command ls reveals a readme file.

Using the cat command to reveal its content we get the password for the next level.
